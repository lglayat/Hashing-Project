# Hashing-Project

The purpose of this repository is to run a test suite of Hashmap implementations using different hashing algorithms and collision-resolution methods. (Open Chaining and Linear Probing)

My hypothesis, testing parameters, and conclusion are described in length in the paper listed in this repo under the name 'hashingPaper.pdf'

To run the test suite you need Eclipse or another updated Java IDE.

Once you have the directory open in your IDE, run the file TestHashing.java to view the test results.
